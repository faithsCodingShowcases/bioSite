			<p>Dr. Jane Goodall is a British ethologist who is widely regarded as the world's foremost expert on chimpanzees.
			She was born in London in 1934 and developed a passion for animals from an early age. 
			She moved to Africa in 1957 and began working as a secretary for the renowned archaeologist and paleontologist 
			Louis Leakey. In 1960, Leakey sent Goodall to Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania to study the behavior of 
			wild chimpanzees. She was the first person to observe that chimpanzees use tools, have complex social relationships, 
			and express emotions. Her groundbreaking discoveries challenged the conventional views of human uniqueness and 
			revolutionized the field of primatology.</p>
			<p> Goodall earned her Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1965, despite not having a formal undergraduate degree. 
			She continued her research at Gombe until 1975, and then founded the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977 to promote conservation
			and animal welfare. She also established the Roots & Shoots program in 1991 to empower young people to take action for 
			positive change in their communities and the environment. Goodall has received numerous awards and honors for her 
			scientific and humanitarian work, including the Kyoto Prize, the Hubbard Medal, the Tyler Prize, the Templeton Prize, 
			and the Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. She has also written several books, such as In the Shadow of 
			Man, Through a Window, and Reason for Hope. She is an advocate for peace, compassion, and respect for all living beings, 
			and travels the world to spread </p>
