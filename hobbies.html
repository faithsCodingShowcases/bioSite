			<p>In her six decades of research, Goodall unveiled the intricate fabric of chimpanzee society. 
			She revealed their tool-making abilities, their complex social structures, and their emotional lives. 
			These insights transformed our perception of these primates and highlighted their cultural richness.</p>
			<h1>Spends Most of Her Time in Nature</h1>

			<p>Jane Goodall has a love for protecting and being in nature. In 1991, she set up Roots and Shoots, a youth-activism program 
			that now has local groups across 60 countries, in which young people are running more than 5,800 community projects to support 
			people, animals and the planet. Three years later, she launched the Jane Goodall Institute’s flagship conservation program, 
			which invests in social programs in villages in Tanzania, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and beyond, and then 
			enlists villagers to help with tree planting and forest monitoring.
			<h1>Building and Maintaining Relationships With Chimpanzees</h1>
            <img src="img/hobby3.jpg" alt="Relationships" width="900" height="750">
			<p> Jane Goodall immersed herself within the chimpanzee communities. She didn’t merely observe from a distance; 
			she named each individual, forming intimate bonds with them. Through this close interaction, she discovered 
			that chimpanzees share remarkable similarities with humans. 
			Their gestures, kisses, embraces, and even their capacity for violence and altruism fascinated her.</p>
